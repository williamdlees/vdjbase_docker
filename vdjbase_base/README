This 'base image' has versions of Python and R with all required libraries. This takes a while to build.
The vdjbase image uses this one as a starting point. Putting all the library installation into this base
image means that the vdjbase image can be rebuilt quickly (pulling in new code from bitbucket) without
needing to wait for the libraries to install. Just remember to refresh this image to get new libraries.

- to build: docker build --no-cache -t vdjbase_base .
