To update the app:
- modify the code as you want
- build the app: docker build --no-cache -t vdjbase . 
- from Container Station press Edit, Validate YML and Apply. No need to make any changes to the YML
- to migrate, telnet into the flask container from Container station: then flask db migrate, flask db upgrade
- (can block port 80 on the router first to avoid issues)
